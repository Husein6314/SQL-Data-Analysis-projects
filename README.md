## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA) 🧐📊

During the exploratory data analysis phase, I performed the following tasks:

1️⃣ Count Unique Apps: I checked for unique app IDs in both tables to avoid duplication.

2️⃣ Check for Missing Values: I investigated the presence of missing values in key fields, specifically in the 'id' and 'track_name' columns.

3️⃣ Number of Apps per Genre: I determined the number of apps per genre, providing insight into the distribution of apps across different categories.

4️⃣ Ratings Overview: I obtained an overview of the app ratings, including the minimum, maximum, and average user ratings.

DATA ANALYSIS 📈📉

In the data analysis phase, I conducted the following analyses:

1️⃣ App Type and Ratings: I examined whether paid apps have higher ratings than free apps.

2️⃣ Apps with Multilingual Support: I explored whether apps with more supported languages tend to have higher user ratings.

3️⃣ Highest-Priced Categories: I identified which app category had the highest prices.

4️⃣ Low-Rated Genres: I checked for genres with low user ratings.

5️⃣ Description Length and User Ratings: I investigated whether there is a correlation between the length of the app description and user ratings.

CONCLUSION 📝🤝

In conclusion, my analysis of the Apple App Store dataset has revealed several noteworthy findings:

1️⃣ App Pricing: Paid apps tend to receive slightly higher ratings compared to free apps. 💲📈

2️⃣ Multilingual Support: Apps that support more than 40 languages tend to have higher user ratings, highlighting the importance of language accessibility. 🌐🌟

3️⃣ Pricing by Category: Utility, Business, Medical, and Education apps emerge as the highest-priced categories. 💼🏥📚

4️⃣ Low-Rated Genres: Catalogs, Finance, and Book apps are among the lowest-rated genres, suggesting areas for potential improvement. 📚💔

5️⃣ Description Length: I found that apps with longer descriptions generally enjoy better user ratings. This insight will be valuable for optimizing app descriptions. 📝🌟

These findings provide valuable insights for my project and can serve as a basis for informed decision-making. I will summarize and present these insights in my GitHub readme to provide a clear overview of the key takeaways from my data analysis. 📄👩‍💻📊🚀

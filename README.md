# SQL-Data-Analysis-projects
## This project is regarding to a data analysis project using SQLite.
**Problem Statement:** 🤔

We have been provided with a dataset from the Apple App Store, The goal is to conduct a comprehensive data analysis to derive meaningful insights from this dataset. However, during the initial phases of the project, we encountered two significant challenges:

1. **Data Import Difficulty**: Initially, I faced difficulties importing the dataset from an Excel file into MySQL Workbench. This challenge slowed down the data analysis process and required a workaround to proceed with the analysis.

2. **SQLite Limitations**: Although I was able to import the data into SQLite successfully, I encountered limitations in SQLite's capacity to handle large datasets efficiently. This limitation compelled me to split the dataset into smaller portions to facilitate analysis in SQLite.

Overcoming these initial hurdles and making the dataset analysis-ready posed an interesting challenge. However, these issues were resolved by switching to SQLite and splitting the dataset into manageable segments. Now, with the dataset ready for analysis, I am poised to dive deeper into exploring the data and extracting valuable insights to drive decision-making and project objectives effectively. 🚀📊📈

## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA) 🧐📊

During the exploratory data analysis phase, I performed the following tasks:

1️⃣ Count Unique Apps: I checked for unique app IDs in both tables to avoid duplication.

2️⃣ Check for Missing Values: I investigated the presence of missing values in key fields, specifically in the 'id' and 'track_name' columns.

3️⃣ Number of Apps per Genre: I determined the number of apps per genre, providing insight into the distribution of apps across different categories.

4️⃣ Ratings Overview: I obtained an overview of the app ratings, including the minimum, maximum, and average user ratings.

DATA ANALYSIS 📈📉

In the data analysis phase, I conducted the following analyses:

1️⃣ App Type and Ratings: I examined whether paid apps have higher ratings than free apps.

2️⃣ Apps with Multilingual Support: I explored whether apps with more supported languages tend to have higher user ratings.

3️⃣ Highest-Priced Categories: I identified which app category had the highest prices.

4️⃣ Low-Rated Genres: I checked for genres with low user ratings.

5️⃣ Description Length and User Ratings: I investigated whether there is a correlation between the length of the app description and user ratings.

CONCLUSION 📝🤝

In conclusion, my analysis of the Apple App Store dataset has revealed several noteworthy findings:

1️⃣ App Pricing: Paid apps tend to receive slightly higher ratings compared to free apps. 💲📈

2️⃣ Multilingual Support: Apps that support more than 40 languages tend to have higher user ratings, highlighting the importance of language accessibility. 🌐🌟

3️⃣ Pricing by Category: Utility, Business, Medical, and Education apps emerge as the highest-priced categories. 💼🏥📚

4️⃣ Low-Rated Genres: Catalogs, Finance, and Book apps are among the lowest-rated genres, suggesting areas for potential improvement. 📚💔

5️⃣ Description Length: I found that apps with longer descriptions generally enjoy better user ratings. This insight will be valuable for optimizing app descriptions. 📝🌟

These findings provide valuable insights for my project and can serve as a basis for informed decision-making. I will summarize and present these insights in my GitHub readme to provide a clear overview of the key takeaways from my data analysis. 📄👩‍💻📊🚀
